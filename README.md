# NixvimChad - the NvChad config for NixVim

NixvimChad is a Neovim distribution built using [NixVim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim), designed to mimic [NvChad](https://nvchad.com) as closely as possible.

> [!WARNING]
> NixvimChad depends on features not currently present in upstream NixVim. The flake inputs for NixvimChad are therefore pointed to [my own fork of NixVim](https://github.com/thecolorman/nixvim). The input will be changed once upstream has the required features (see [the fork diff](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim/compare/main...TheColorman:nixvim:main) for the features NixvimChad requires).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NixvimChad is developed for my own personal use, so I can't guarantee quality or that everything will work properly. For example, some NvChad plugins rely on hardcoded paths to `~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/`, as they would ordinarily be installed there, instead of the Nix store. Whenever I run intro a problem I try to fix it, and if you open an issue I'll probably take a look at that too, but you should expect there to be bugs.

## Try

You can try out NixvimChad with the following command:

```bash
nix run github:thecolorman/nixvimchad
# or edit a file
nix run github:thecolorman/nixvimchad -- file.nix
```

## Why?

NvChad is a great set of default plugins for Neovim that turns the editor into an IDE. At the same time, NvChad (and Vim in a broader sense) relies on mutable configuration in your home directory, which goes against the immutable and declarative philosophy of Nix. NixVim was created to address this, being a Neovim distribution entirely designed around configuring Neovim using the Nix language.

NvChad is a very popular starting point for Neovim configurations, but getting it to work in NixVim is a pain due to the differing configuration philosophies. That's where NixvimChad comes in!

## How?

NixvimChad emulates every step of a normal NvChad configuration by manually converting NvChad's Lua code into a NixVim configuration. The entire program flow of the default NvChad configuration has been tirelessly converted to equivalent NixVim code, even making use of [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/) for lazy-loading and bytecode compilation!

## Extending

You can use NixvimChad as the base for your own NixVim config by using the exposed `configure` helper. NixvimChad adds new options to the NixVim configuratoin under the `chad` option.

> [!NOTE]
> `configure` is just a wrapper over NixVim's [`<nixvim>.extend`](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/platforms/standalone.html?highlight=extend#extending-an-existing-configuration) function. `configure` creates a package for each supported system, where `<nixvim>.extend` only extends a single package.

Nix flake template:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixvimchad.url = "github:thecolorman/nixvimchad";
  };

  outputs = {nixvimchad, ...}:
    nixvimchad.configure (import ./config);
};
```

The `configure` function will generate the proper `package` attributes for your flake. You can then write your NixVim config like normal:  

```nix
# config/default.nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  extraConfigLua = ''
    -- your lua config here
  '';
}
```

In addition, NixvimChad exposes new options under `chad` that allow you to disable or override the configuration to any of the plugins used in NvChad:

```nix
# config/default.nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  # For example, to enable the nixd language server
  # taken from https://github.com/NvChad/starter/blob/main/lua/plugins/init.lua:
  chad.plugins.lspconfig.pluginConfig = {
    # You can put anything in here that is defined at https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/plugins/lazy/plugins.html
    config = ''
      function()
        require("nvchad.configs.lspconfig").defaults()

        local lspconfig = require "lspconfig"

        local servers = { "nixd" }
        local nvlsp = require "nvchad.configs.lspconfig"

        for _, lsp in ipairs(servers) do
          lspconfig[lsp].setup {
            on_attach = nvlsp.on_attach,
            on_init = nvlsp.on_init,
            capabilities = nvlsp.capabilities,
          }
        end
      end
    '';
  };
}
```

The list of NvChad options is currently not documented, but you can see the available plugins under `chad.plugins` in [`plugins/`](./plugins). Every plugin has the following options, defined in [`lib/default.nix`](./lib/default.nix):

* `enable` - Whether to enable the plugin. On by default. If other plugins have the disabled plugin as a dependency, they will try to disable functionality that depends on it.  
* `pluginConfig` - An attribute set that is passed to NixVim's `plugins.lazy.plugins.*` configuration. See the [NixVim documentation for Lazy plugins](https://nix-community.github.io/nixvim/plugins/lazy/plugins.html) for a list of options.  
* `pkg` - The package used by the plugin. Most of these are from nixpkgs, but some of the NvChad builtin plugins are fetched directly from GitHub.

You can then run your configuration with `nix run` or add it as an input in your NixOS system flake to add the executable to your NixOS configuration:

```nix
# system flake
{
  inputs.nixvimcfg.url = "github:<your_name>/<your_repository>";
  # ... other inputs
  
  outputs = {nixvimcfg, ...}: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      hostname = inputs.nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        modules = [
          ./configuration.nix
          {
            environment.systemPackages = [ nixvimcfg.packages.x86_64-linux.default ];
          }
        ];
      };
    };
  };
}
```
